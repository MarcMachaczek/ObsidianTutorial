Hi everyone, 
the "Hacky Our Obsidian" Vault folder contains all files we have created in todays tutorial.
A great starting point for further reading is the following https://github.com/drshahizan/obsidian?tab=readme-ov-file.

Finally, don't worry too much about all the plug-ins etc, in the end the **most important** thing is that you write down stuff. While doing so, you will find out which way of organizing your own notes / knowledge works best for you, there is no tutorial that does this for you. In the end obsidian should serve your purpose, not the other way around. Also, your way of organizing your notes will change over time.

I just want to mention a few very important points that I learned while using obsidian and while talking to others, for which I would claim some universality or usefulness:

1) Always back up your vault (git, Pcloud, Obsidian subscription, any backup software really, also you can use Nextcloud!)
2) Write notes, then you will notice what plug-ins you might need that fit your workflow.
3) Intersection of plug-ins I can recommend personally and think might be useful for most of you:
	- "Templater" and "Linter" for note templates and uniform formatting of your notes
	- "DataView" to query your own notes, particularly useful if you include literature into your vault (make use of the front matter / properties section of your note!)
	- "Latex Suite" making it easier to type Latex in Obsidian
	- "Tasks" for task management / todo lists
	- any back-up plug-in like "git" if you don't want to pay for the obsidian subscription (which gives you nice sync anc version history across devices)
4) Ask any LLM like GPT or Claude to output a detailed summary of your conversion in markdown format, you can just copy paste it into Obsidian
