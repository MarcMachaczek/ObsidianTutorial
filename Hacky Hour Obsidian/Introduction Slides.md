### What is Obsidian?
- local-first knowledge management system built on plain Markdown files
- treats your notes as a knowledge graph, not as a hierarchical structure
- available on all platforms: Linux, MacOS, Windows, iOS and Android
- big community and many plug-ins available
- **your data is yours**

|                                     its free to use, with a paid option for syncing                                     |     | collaboration and sharing is not straight-forward |
|                                                       it is fast                                                        |     |           mobile version can be fiddly            |
|                           highly customizable, many available plug-ins and community content                            |     |   steep learning curve (depends on who you ask)   |
| you own your files: If Obsidian would vanish in the next 10 seconds, you still have all your knowledge easily accesible |     |        core application is not open source        |
